# Positive Petals

**Positive Petals** is a habit-tracking application designed to help users overcome bad habits through a visual growth mechanism. Users can track their progress by interacting with a tree that grows as they resist their cravings and diminishes if they fail.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Simple login system to track individual progress.
- **Interactive Habit Tracking**: Click 'I Will Do It' to grow your tree and 'I Can't' if you give in.
- **Visual Growth Representation**: The tree evolves from a sapling to a fully-grown tree with flowers and fruits.
- **Monthly Reward System**: Users can indulge in their habit guilt-free at the end of the month if they succeed.
- **Confession Mechanism**: If a user fails, they must confess, causing the tree to start dying.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: ReactJS
- **Styling**: Plain CSS
- **Database**: Simple state management within React (No external backend)
